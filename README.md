# UART_TX
UART Transmitter using Verilog, (to get the most out of it) Before using the code try to implement the project on your own using the specs from CRC.pdf. also try to avoid using AI tools as you can, you are still learning so don't forget to learn how to think. 
Feel free to ask me if you run into any issues.
