# UART_TX
UART Transmitter using Verilog, There is a Do file that can be used with QuestaSim or ModelSim tools to check the testbench cases faster. 
(to get the most out of it) Before using the code try to implement the project on your own using the specs from UART_TX.pdf. also try to avoid using AI tools as you can, you are still learning so don't forget to learn how to think. 
Feel free to ask me if you run into any issues.
